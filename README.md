### Project 1- NFL Data
This repository highlights SQL code I used for various DDL/DML methods in the setup, cleaning and analysis of my graduate NFL project. My group wanted to understand key indicators for teams' successes in the NFL. The data comes from https://www.kaggle.com/tobycrabtree/nfl-scores-and-betting-data.

Our Oracle SQL code helped cleaned the data, set new columns, and prepare necessary information for usage in a Tableau dashboard. I would share the Tableau dashboard as well, but since completing the project, our data was removed from our Oracle Database, no longer being fed into Tableau. 

I was responsible for a majority the SQL statements. 

I created two Tableau visuals. Aaron and rest of the group focused heavily on data analysis.

This repository includes:
- 2 SQL files
- A PDF document showcasing a high level description of steps taken in database preparation

# DatabaseProgramming
This repository highlights SQL code I used for various DDL/DML methods in the setup, cleaning and analysis of my graduate NFL project. The data comes from https://www.kaggle.com/tobycrabtree/nfl-scores-and-betting-data. 

Our SQL code helped cleaned the data, set new columns, and prepare necessary information for usage in a Tableau dashboard. I would share the Tableau dashboard as well, but since completing the project, our data was removed from our Oracle Database Schema. 

This repository includes:
- 2 SQL files
- A PDF document showcasing a high level description of steps taken in database preparation
